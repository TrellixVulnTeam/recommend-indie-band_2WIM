<p>It’s been four years since Natasha Khan released the stunning <i>The Haunted Man</i>, her third record as Bat for Lashes.
	After the misstep side project that was Sexwitch, it was important Khan came back on top of her game.
	With this month’s <i>The Bride</i>, she’s done just that: a concept record packed with emotion and haunting beauty, the fourth and newest Bat for Lashes album is one that grows with each
	listen and reinforces Khan’s status as one of alternative music’s most imaginative performers.
</p>
<p>
	On the record, Khan portrays a titular bride-to-be whose fiancé dies in a car accident on his way to the wedding.
	The album opens up on a hopeful note with “I Do,” as Khan extols her love over a heavenly riff: “Tomorrow you will take me as your bride / And know that the grey skies will blow away,” she sings.
	Lurking in the shadows, however is a sense of foreboding, as ominously low strings coincide with the lyric “when you say I do,” foreshadowing the pain that lies on the horizon.
	The premonition is expanded on follow-up track “Joe’s Dream,” as Khan describes her fiancé’s visions of “God’s searchlight” and “a body on the checkered floor.”
	The music itself features a rumbling drum pattern and guitar riff that mark a drastic change in atmosphere from “I Do,” as Khan fearfully whispers several of her lines.
</p>
<p>
	These omens materialize over the next two tracks, as Khan’s narrator transforms from a starry-eyed lover to a lost, grieving almost-widow.
	On “In God’s House,” you can almost hear the character’s heart break as she sits in a church, waiting for a husband that will never arrive.
	She feels in her heart that something isn’t right, and images of her fiancé dead on a beach and fire from a car crash,
	the later providing one of the album’s most painfully desperate refrains as Khan cries “fire” repeatedly. “Honeymooning Alone” begins with the sounds of the crash itself,
	before Khan’s bride tries to reconcile with her grief in the immediate aftermath of tragedy, complete with an instrumental and dramatic cadence that recall the sounds of Lana Del Rey.
</p>
<p>
	From then on, <i>The Bride</i> follows Khan’s narrator as she copes with the loss of her one true love.
	“Sunday Love” picks up the pace briefly with a pulsating beat as the “grey skies” cast aside on “I Do” make an unwelcome return.
	The protagonist questions her own religiousity on “Never Forgive the Angels,” making her wrath towards God and his decision to take her fiancé away known.
	For a brief moment, Khan resolves to love again, but album closer “Clouds” seems to suggest the narrator has resigned herself to her fate, as the clouds return once again and Khan relents,
	“I am lost until some day / When you will come and find me.” Overall, the story arc portrayed in <i>The Bride</i> showcases a realistic version of grief, albeit with a handful of supernatural elements.
</p>
<p>
	While lyrically and emotionally stirring, musically speaking, <i>The Bride</i> is a bit of a mixed bag.
	A number tracks are slow and feature sparse instrumentation, and it often works to Khan’s advantage: we’ve already discussed the merits of “I Do” and “Joe’s Dream,”
	and the ascending sounds of “I Will Love Again” perfectly represent the song’s attempt at slowly emerging from sorrow with cautious optimism.
	But sometimes, the lack of pace or dynamism can lead to tracks that drag on listlessly and are hard to distinguish from one another.
	The album has an incredibly cinematic feel - perhaps best displayed by the sweeping “Close Encounters” - but at times this atmosphere comes across as forced and overly involved.
	Nothing captures <i>The Bride’s</i> (admittedly few) shortcomings as “Widow’s Peak,” a bizarre, witch-like spoken word piece that’s frankly pointless and does nothing but break up the record’s
	flow and confuse the listener.
</p>
<p>
Despite these flaws, <i>The Bride</i> remains an incisive journey into the depths of depression and lost love.
The story is gripping even during the few moments when the music itself isn’t, and the character Khan has created is one whom you can both empathize with and admire the strength of.
To be able to capture the sounds of both a promising, loving future and the most plunging sadness imaginable on the same record without sounding disjointed is no small feat,
and Natasha Khan is the perfect artist for the job.

<i>The Bride</i> is out now on Parlophone
