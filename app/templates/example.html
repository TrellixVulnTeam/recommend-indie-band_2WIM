<p>It seems evidentially clear that music of the 2015-2016 era has been heavily inspired through different avenues of political turmoil and individualistic expression.
	On Blood Orange’’s (Devonté Hynes) third LP, <i>Freetown Sound</i>, he makes it abundantly clear that he is, indeed, a part of the movement as well.
	The title alone demonstrates authenticity and deep rooted ties to the city of Freetown, Sierra Leone.
	Hynes intent for his third project was to communicate with those who were misunderstood in society and even their own subcultures.
	To validate this argument, the very first song “By Ourselves”, jumps out the gate discussing the hardships and misunderstandings of what it is like to be a woman working in man’s world
	accompanied by intricate saxophone solos and mesmerizing Motown background vocals. Throughout the progression of this project, Hynes leaves every track dripping with a unique combination of
	light and airy R&B melodies and 808s that can bring anyone back to walking the streets of New York in the 1980s.
</p>
<p>
	While it may remain true that Hynes associates himself with primarily artists of the indie pop and rock scene,
	he has quickly become a pioneer of the new wave R&B sound. Other notable acts who have derived inspiration through the soul and R&B scene notably are,
	<a href="/artist/Anderson%20Paak">Anderson Paak</a> and <a href="/artist/Allan%20Kingdom">Allan Kingdom</a>, amongst others. To come to no surprise, Devonté Hynes loves to work with his female colleagues.
	This album, compared to his last two, utilized the soft touch and storytelling of a woman to illustrate his point of view as a man.
	Once former blow-up stars like, <a href="/artist/Nelly%20Furtado">Nelly Furtado</a> and <a href="/artist/Carly%20Rae%20Jepsen">Carly Rae Jespen</a>,
	this R&B mastermind wanted to reach out to a broader scope of his audience.
		By facilitating these once known artists as focal point on his album, it becomes more transparent that his inspiration comes from female musicians.
		Along with his accompaniment of these talented female musicians, tracks like “Better Numb” and ‘E.V.P.” proves that this his most intimate project to date.
		Track by track, Hynes details the hardships any musician, big or small, has once the final curtain closes. Love, R&B, and self-identity are the three major keys to take away from
		Blood Orange’s latest 17 song masterpiece.
</p>
<p>
	This album proves monumental growth for the middle aged British singer/songwriter. While many could argue that the success of <i>Coastal Grooves</i> and <i>Champagne Coast</i> were deeply
	overshadowed by <i>Cupid Deluxe</i>, Hynes has proven that his position in the dog-eat-dog R&B business is evident and well-known. With this early launch of his LP, Hynes will be 
	all over the country and the world performing in a plethora of festivals. Check it out.
