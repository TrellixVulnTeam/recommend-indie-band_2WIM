16 years. It has been 16 long years since the debut of the Avalanches first album, <i>Since I Left You</i>. Many who are unfamiliar with this group might be asking, what is the big deal with these guys if they can’‘t even produce an album for such an extended period of time? Well, I will tell you why. Starting as early as 1998, a group of three Aussies were initially out to explore their options as a noise punk band, but were abruptly halted when one of their pivotal members was deported. However, through this unfortunate dismemberment, this group of three realized that their core passion was through the heavy usage of vinyl sampling. In the same breath, one should take into consideration how precise and particular these producers must be in order to successfully execute an all-sampled project. With the already astounding critical acclaim of the album, it is evident how religiously dedicated the group was with this second go around. It is easy to overlook the time frame of this project being completed as dilly-dally, but until you commit some time to some to deep listening, it will be impossible to understand.

The first tracks on <i>Wildflower</i>, ultimately, set the tone for the entirety of the project. Kicking off with “Because of Me”, “Frank Sinatra”, and “Subways” all feature a staunch lineup of premium MCs in today’‘s indie stratosphere. These tracks incorporate the lyrically captivating MF Doom and Danny Brown to produce unmatchable summertime tunes. Not to mention, the long lived icon, Biz Markie, appears on the silly yet charming track “Noisy Eater.” Coming at a time where Biz has been virtually non-existent since the late 80’‘s, this feature sends the project into a nostalgic time warp where Looney Toons reigned supreme. Additionally, the Avalanches do an impeccable job in letting featured MCs shine and glimmer through their thoroughly processed rhythms. However, the list of indie favorites doesn’‘t end there. Also making appearances, Chaz Bundick from Toro y Moi, Kevin Parker (Tame Impala), Father John Misty, and Camp Lo’‘s own, Geechi Suede and Sonny Cheeba. The time period of delivery and the overall aroma of this project both go hand in hand. Every scratch, sample, and rhythm altercation were all mixed in a way to remind the listeners about the times where life was much simpler. Bursting fire hydrants all over city streets and chasing the neighborhood ice cream truck are definitively complimentary to this immaculate 22 track project.

To expand on the progression of their exploding popularity, in the beginning, the group started off in 2000 with a Modular Recordings deal which eventually gave exclusive license to Universal Music Australia (once the decline of Modular became evident). With this successful distribution deal, this made it clear how much faith Universal had in these young Aussies. It especially solidifies trust because it took them 16 years to come up with a new record. But with sweet words, it safe to say that the drought of talented mixing projects is finally over. Inspiration for young artists all over, including Oddisee and Apollo Brown, has resurged the craving for well formulated sample projects since the <i>Donuts</i> era. Somewhere in heaven, J Dilla is smiling that someone was able to share the same passion for creating these special masterpieces. Recently, Australia has been entering the years with artists that will make you drop your vegemite sandwich. I think I speak for many other fans out there when I say that this may just be the beginning for The Avalanches. I am excited to hear what is next on their agenda.
